[[section-introduction-and-goals]]
== Introduction and Goals

Following describes the architecture of eFLows4HPC Data Catalog. The service
will provide information about data sets used in the project. The catalog will
store info about locations, schemas, and additional metadata.

Main features:

* keep track of data sources
* enable registration of new data sources
* provide user-view as well as simple API to access the information

=== Requirements Overview

[cols="1,2,4"]
|===
| **ID** | **Requirement** | **Explanation**

| R1 | View data sources | View the list of data sources and details on particular ones (web page + api)
| R2 | Register data sets | Authenticated users should be able register/change data sets with additional metadata
| R3 | No schema MD | We don't impose a schema for the metadata (not know what is relevant)
| R4 | Documented API | Swagger/OpenAPI
|===

=== Quality Goals

| **ID** | **Prio**| **Quality**| **Explanation**

| Q1 | 1 | Extensibility | Possibility to add new metadata to existing rows
| Q2 | 2 | Interoperability | The service should work with Data Logistics
| Q3 | 2 | Deployability | Quick/automatic deployment

== Architecture Constraints


[cols="1,4"]
|===
| **Constraint** | **Explanation**

| Authentication | There is no solution for that in the project yet, local authenticator?
| Deployment | We shall use CI/CD, the project will also be a playing field to setup this and test before the Data Logistics
| github vs. gitlab | Not sure if we can use our local gitlab
| Docker-based Deployment | This technology will be used in the project anyways

== System Scope and Context

=== Business Context

=== Technical Context

**Mapping Input/Output to Channels**

User -> Data Catalog: simple (static?) web page view

Data Logistics -> Data catalog HTTP/API read-only

Admin -> Data Catalog: either a web page or CLI

[[section-solution-strategy]]
== Solution Strategy

=== Speed and flexibility
This product will not be very mission critical, we want to keep it simple. A solution even without a backend database would be possible. Probably we
will use some noSQL database for maximal flexibility. API with Swagger/OpenAPI (e.g. fastAPI). Frontend static page with JavaScript calls to the API. 

=== Deployment with Jenkins

1. Jenkins instance in HDF Cloud to setup Pipelines,
2. Code in Github/Gitlab
3. Automatic deployment with Docker? Docker-compose
